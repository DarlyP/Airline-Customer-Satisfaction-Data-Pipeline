## Data Source

Kaggle: [Airlines Customer satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction).

---

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing airline customer satisfaction data using Apache Airflow, ElasticSearch, and Kibana. This project will encompass data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, real-time data indexing, and interactive visualization of insights. By integrating these powerful tools, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive solution for managing, analyzing, and visualizing airline customer satisfaction metrics efficiently.

## Conclusion

Several significant findings emerge from the analysis of the Invistico Airlines dataset comprising 129,487 records. Firstly, most customers travel for business purposes (69.08%), underscoring the airline's strong presence in the business travel market. Secondly, the age groups of 25, 39, and 44 years old are the most frequent users of Invistico Airlines' services, indicating strategic potential in tailoring services and promotions to meet the needs of these age groups. Thirdly, while most customers are satisfied with the services, there is still room to improve customer loyalty, especially among dissatisfied customers. Fourthly, the Eco Plus service class receives the highest average ratings, highlighting the importance of additional amenities or comfort in attracting customer satisfaction. Lastly, despite relatively high satisfaction with cleanliness and seat comfort, some areas require more attention to maintain cleanliness and comfort standards.

Based on the exploration of the dataset and considering business needs and trends in the aviation industry, we provide several further recommendations and business insights:

1. Personalized Services
2. Experience-Focused Loyalty Programs
3. Product and Service Innovation
4. Improved Cleanliness and Comfort
